:construction: Site in construction :construction:

Due to the API URL uses the **HTTP** protocol, for most of browsers is not secure and the APP is not going to run.
To fix this, I recommend you to follow the next steps:
1) Copy and paste this link into your browser: https://movielify.netlify.app
2) Click in the padlock and click "Site settings"
<img src="src/assets/step1.png" width="250px" heigth="250px"/>
3) Find "Insecure content" and select "Allow"
<img src="src/assets/step2.png" width="550px" heigth="450px"/>

4) Go back to the site and press F5 (refresh the page). Now your browser is going to run the site :smile:
